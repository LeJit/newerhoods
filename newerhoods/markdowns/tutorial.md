### How to use NewerHoods
___
Follow these five simple steps to begin creating NewerHoods of your own.

##### Step 1 Select features of interest
To start building your own NewerHoods, browse and choose characteristics from the drop-down menu and click the Select button. The tool will return clusters based on your selection(s) and produce an output map. You can use the same button to update your selection at any stage. For more details on each of the features, click the information icon.

##### Step 2 Choose number of new neighborhoods
Next, you can use the slider to choose the number of NewerHoods into which you want to divide New York City. The map automatically updates every time you change the number to neighborhoods to view. As a starting point, consider  settings that correspond to the cityâ€™s existing administrative divisions.

- Community Districts: 59
- Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs): 55
- Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs): 195
- Police Precincts: 77
- School Districts: 33

##### Step 3 Dig into the numbers
Having generated a map of NewerHoods, you can pan and zoom the map to your area of interest. Hovering over a cluster, you'll find the NewerHood highlight and a pop-up window showing the average statistics of the characteristics chosen.

##### Step 4 Check out different views
When you select  the Heatmap plot, the NewerHoods will be colored according to the magnitude of the values. When multiple features are chosen, the magnitude represents a combination of all the chosen features. You can use them to find broadly similar neighborhoods by simply looking at similarly colored areas.

##### Step 5 Compare
Lastly, you can compare the NewerHoods to existing geographical boundaries. The chosen division appears on the map as a white dashed line.
