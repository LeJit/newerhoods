### How to use NewerHoods
___
##### #1 Select features of interest
You can start by browsing and selecting chararacteristics from the drop down menu and clicking the *Select* button. This selects the features which are clustered and an output map is produced. You can also use the same button to update your selection at any stage. To get more details on each of the features, use the information icon. 

##### #2 Choose number of neighborhoods
Next, you can use the slider to choose the number of neighborhoods you want to see New York City divided up into. The map automatically updates everytime you change the number to neighborhoods to view. As a starting point, you can look at settings that correspond to existing administrative divisions of New York City.

- Community Districts: 59
- Public Use Micordata Areas (PUMAs): 55
- Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs): 195
- Police Precincts: 77
- School Districts: 33

##### #3 Dig into the numbers
Given a selection of features and number of neighborhoods, you can view the map of the NewerHoods. You can pan and zoom the map to your area of interest. Hovering over a cluster, you'll find the NewerHood highlight and a pop-up window showing the average statistics of the characteristics chosen. 

##### #4 Check out different views
By choosing the Heatmap plot, you will find the NewerHoods coloured based on the magnitude of the values. When multiple features are chosen, the magnitude represent a combination of all the chosen features. These can be used to find broadly similar neighborhoods by simply looking at similarly coloured areas. 

##### #5 Compare
Lastly, you can compare the NewerHoods to existing geographical boundaries. The chosen division appears on the map as a white dashed line.
