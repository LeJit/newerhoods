##### Housing
In terms of housing characteristics of a neighborhood, we look at the costs and the developments captured by the features below:

- Median Sale Price: The median price per square footage of real-estate sold in last year (2017), last 3 years (2015-2017), and last 5 years (2013-2017). 
- Age of Building: The average age of all real-estate from the time constructed.

##### Crime
In terms of crime, we divide up crimes into the three levels of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation. The count of each of these types is calculated for each region and scaled by its respective population to obtain a rate.

- Violations: Also known as infractions, these are the most minor of offenses. A speeding ticket, public intoxication, or jaywalking are some examples.
- Misdemeanors: These are the second type of criminal offenses. More serious than violations but less severe than felonies, misdemeanors can carry up to a year in jail.
- Felonies: These are the most serious type of criminal offense. Felonies often involve serious physical harm to victims, but they also include offenses like white collar crimes and fraud schemes.
