##### Housing
To evaluate the housing characteristics of a neighborhood, we look at:

- Median Sale Price: The median price per square footage of real-estate sold in the last year (2017), the last three years (2015-2017), and the last five years (2013-2017).
- Age of Building: The average age of residential real-estate from the time constructed.

##### Crime
NewerHoods categorizes crimes into three levels of offense: felony, misdemeanor, and violation. The count of each of these types is calculated for each region and scaled by its respective population to obtain a rate.

- Violations: Also known as infractions, these are the most minor of offenses. A speeding ticket, public intoxication, or jaywalking are some examples.
- Misdemeanors: More serious than violations but less severe than felonies, misdemeanors can carry up to a year in jail.
- Felonies: These are the most serious type of criminal offense. Felonies often involve serious physical harm to victims, but they also include offenses like white collar crimes and fraud schemes.
