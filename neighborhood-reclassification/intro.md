Re-imagine neighborhood boundaries using Open Data and Machine learning

New York City is the City of Neighborhoods. These neighborhoods have gone through a lot of changes over the last decade but our definitions of neighborhoods remain the same. NewerHoods is a tool that allows you to reimagine New York City neighborhoods using Open Data and Machine Learning. NewerHoods lets you select specific characteristics or even upload your own data to visualize the clusters on a map of New York City and even compare against existing geographic divisions.
